Journald is a user-space standalone generic journalling daemon.  It
reads records from multiple clients and writes them to a single journal
in such a way that the client only sees a successful completion only
after the journal is guaranteed to be written to disk (a transaction).

This package is right now in an advanced "alpha" stage.  All of the
necessary parts are there to use it, but some are limited in their
capacity.  The file format will change in a future version to accomodate
block-alligned transactions, but the client-server protocol is not
expected to change.
