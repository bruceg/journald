Journald is a user-space standalone generic journalling daemon.  It
reads records from multiple clients and writes them to a single journal
in such a way that the client only sees a successful completion only
after the journal is guaranteed to be written to disk (a transaction).

Development versions of journald are available via anonymous CVS.
Set your CVSROOT to ":pserver:cvs@bruce-guenter.dyndns.org:/CVS",
login with an empty password, and check out the "journald" module.
