Journalling daemon

- Allows multiple connections
- The data from multiple connections is bundled into large writes to the
  journal
- Guarantees are provided by synchronous writing of 1-byte prefixes
  using fdatasync.
- The journal files have a fixed maximum size.
- Writes past the end of the journal cause a new journal file to be
  created.

Design Decisions:

- Use MD4 as a block check code:
  - Is faster (!) than even a hand-tuned CRC on P2/P3/Celeron CPUs
  - Offers more bits of protection than CRC, thus making it more likely
    to catch partially-written or corrupted data.
  - Even though there are cryptographic attacks against it, we don't use
    it for that purpose.

- Include stream identifier meta-data with the stream

- Delay committing transactions for a fraction of a second

- Uniform length-prefixed string format
