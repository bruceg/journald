- The data file is broken down into transactions, which are composed of
  one or more records.

- Atomic transactions are ensured by the initial "data flag" on each
  transaction.

- Each transaction consists of a control header followed by zero or more
  records, followed by a CRC.

- The transaction immediately following the last one is marked as empty.

- Data from multiple records are concatenated into one transaction.

File Header Format:
- Constant string (8 bytes): "journald"
- Version (1)
- File number (starts at zero)

Record Format:
- Record type (single byte):
  NUL == end of journal, anything else means a potentially valid transaction
  I == record ID
  O == start and end of the records for the given stream
  S == start of the records for the given stream
  E == end of the records for the given stream
  C == continued data for the given stream
  A == abort record
- Stream number
- Record number
- Record data length
- Record data
- A 128-bit MD4 hash on all the data from the non-zero value of the
  record type flag to the last byte of the record data.

- All record types (except "A") may contain data.

- The first record in a transaction is initially marked with a NUL
  record type, which is restored after the rest of the data is sync'ed
  to disk (two-pass algorithm).

- The stream number is a sequential marker that starts at zero when the
  server starts up, and may not be zero for the first record in the
  file.

- The record number is a sequential marker that starts at zero for each
  new stream.

- Possible sequences of record types:
  I O
  I S C* E
  I S C* A

- Unless otherwise noted, all the above numbers are represented as a
  4-byte binary value, MSB first.

- All strings are prefixed with their length

- Record IDs are a string supplied by the client.

- The record ID record always has a record number of zero, and do not
  affect the record numbering of other records.  It contains the current
  offset for that stream followed by the identifier string.

- The record ID record for a given stream will always precede any data
  records for that stream within an individual journal file.

- The following "magic" entries can be used to identify journald files:
0	string		journald	Journald file
>8	belong		x		version %d
>12	belong		x		(file #%ld)
