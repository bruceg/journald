- The data file is broken down into 512 byte blocks
  - This is the same size as the block size on most hard drives, which
    assures us of atomic writes.
  - Page size might make block writes more efficient.

- Each bundle consists of a control header followed by zero or more
  records.

- The bundle immediately following the last one is marked as empty.

- Each bundle is at least one block long, and will always start on a
  block boundary.

- Data from multiple records are concatenated into one bundle.

Control Block Format:
- Total bundle length (in blocks)
  0 means end of journal
- Number of records in this bundle (N)
- N times the following:
  - Record type (single byte):
    S == start of the records for the given ID
    F == first continuation data for the given ID in the journal
         (for records that continue after the end of the journal)
    E == end of the records for the given ID
    O == start and end of record
    C == continued data for the given ID
    All record types may contain data.
    Possible sequences of record types: O; S C* E; F C* E
  - Record ID
  - Offset from start of record data (in bytes, for "F" records only)
  - Record data length (in bytes)
Unless otherwise noted, all the above are numbers represented in ASCII
followed by a NUL byte.
