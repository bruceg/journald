Socket protocol:

- Server sends an identifier code to the client.
- Client sends a series of non-zero length strings.
- Client sends a zero-length string.
- Server sends an acknowledgement code and closes the socket.

Notes:

- All numbers are represented as ASCII decimals followed by a NUL byte.

- A "string" above is represented as a length number followed
  immediately by that many bytes of data.

- It is assumed that the client has written the data to a permanent file
  store (asynchronously) before sending it to the journalling process.

- In the event of restoring the data from the journal, the identifier
  will be used to uniquely identify the record being extracted.  The
  client will either need to use some method of associating that
  identifier with the on-disk record, or embed its own identifier into
  the data.
