Changes in version 0.3

- Modified the core logic to use only a single file (making it suitable
  for raw devices).  Wraparound is handled by first sync'ing all
  filesystems.

- Introduced three journal writing mechanisms, fdatasync, mmap+msync,
  open+direct (O_DIRECT), and open+sync (O_DSYNC).  O_DIRECT support is
  untested.

- Modified file format to introduce a "page size" on which all writes
  are alligned, and switched from MD4 to 64-bit CRC.

- journald now only delays to commit if there are no other open
  connections.

Changes in version 0.2 (unreleased)

New Features:
- journal-read now spawns seperate processes to handle each
  transaction's data stream after the stream is completed.

Internal Changes:
- Modified file format to better support extraction of the seperate
  streams of data, and to avoid repeating the (potentially long) stream
  ID string in each record.
- Optimized the daemon input handler to avoid outputting an extra empty
  end record if the input ends on a CBUFSIZE boundary.

Bug Fixes:
- Fixed handling of partial (non-multiples of 64 bytes) blocks in MD4.
