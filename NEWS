Changes in version 0.3

- Modified the core logic to use only a single file (making it suitable
  for raw devices).  Wraparound is handled by first sync'ing all
  filesystems.

- Modified the journal writing mechanism to use msync instead of
  write+fdatasync.

Changes in version 0.2

New Features:
- journal-read now spawns seperate processes to handle each
  transaction's data stream after the stream is completed.

Internal Changes:
- Modified file format to better support extraction of the seperate
  streams of data, and to avoid repeating the (potentially long) stream
  ID string in each record.
- Optimized the daemon input handler to avoid outputting an extra empty
  end record if the input ends on a CBUFSIZE boundary.

Bug Fixes:
- Fixed handling of partial (non-multiples of 64 bytes) blocks in MD4.
