- When journald is killed, sync and rotate the output file, but don't
  open a new one.

- Make the sync timing intelligent in order to batch transactions.

- Modify journal_read to wait for new records to be output to the
  "current" file.

- Modify the file format to allign transaction starts on block boundaries.
