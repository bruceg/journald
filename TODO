- Write journal_dump program:
  - Loads in the directory listing of the journal directory
  - Reads in each file
  - Outputs a formatted text description of each record in the file
  - Optionally waits for new records to be output to the "current" file

- Make the sync timing intelligent in order to batch transactions.

- Rewrite the state machine in journal_input.c to handle multiple bytes
  at once, for efficiency during long block reads.
